### Empty Pockets

In order to keep up to date with my fruitful spending habbits, I created a Web App that allows me to keep track of personal expenses. 

Empty Pockets allows you to enter both deposits and withdrawls, giving you a balance of your funds. 

As a bonus I added statistics and report percentages based off of withdrawl/deposit amounts.
