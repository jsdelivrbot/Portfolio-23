Knowing that there is always something new to learn in development is both astonishing and intimidating. I find myself wanting to know as much as possible, never trully satisified with my present set of skills. But I am self aware that this is a great thing, as it motivates me to wake up earlier each day and learn more. Everything I have learned as been from the Tech Academy, Udemy, as well as self practice.
