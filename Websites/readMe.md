### Sample Websites
***

A collection of websites I have built in order to ameliorate my webdevelopment skills. Here I showcase my very first websites, as well as other projects I am proud to call mine.

Please feel free to browse each project folder to learn about my approach to solving software problems. Each folder also contains a readme file that explains the project's objective, the approach I took to resolve the challenge and the result.
