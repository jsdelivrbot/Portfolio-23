### Checking if Different Work Branches Are Open
***

### About
Here I created a python script that would check if different work branches are open reagarding their time-zone location. This script checks time-zones in Portland, New York, and London.

### Impediments I Overcame
The most time-consuming problem that I confronted was arguably just trying to get pytz imported. It seemed as if every approach I tried gave me a error of some sort. I overcame this, really just by luck after many attempts; I uninstalled my Python 2.7 and installed Python 3. From there, I used PIP to install the module which worked fine.

I really used my knowledge of JavaScript to help with this solution of checking time-zones. Learning about if/else statements in JavaScript made it easy to implement a solution in Python for this script.
